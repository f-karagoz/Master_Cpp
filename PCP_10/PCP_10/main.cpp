/* Cpp Reference: std::shared_mutex
 The shared_mutex class is a synchronization primitive that can be used to protect shared data from being simultaneously accessed by multiple threads. In contrast to other mutex types which facilitate exclusive access, a shared_mutex has two levels of access:

 shared - several threads can share ownership of the same mutex.
 exclusive - only one thread can own the mutex.

// readers read the same value till a writer comes and changes it
